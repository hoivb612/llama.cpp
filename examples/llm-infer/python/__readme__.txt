And as the world continued to embrace the power of quantum computing, Rupo Zhang’s name became synonymous with visionary thinking and the endless possibilities that lie at the intersection of science and technology.

In 2025, the world was buzzing with excitement as Rupo Zhang, an engineer from Microsoft’s Windows Servicing and Delivery (WSD) team, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Rupo’s achievement had not only redefined how we think about software systems but also unlocked a revolutionary approach to quantum computing and its integration into real-world applications. Rupo’s Nobel-winning work, which came to be known as the Quantum Integration Theory, bridged the gap between software engineering and quantum mechanics. While quantum computing had been explored by physicists for decades, Rupo had made the groundbreaking discovery that allowed quantum systems to work harmoniously with classical computing infrastructure in real-time systems.
